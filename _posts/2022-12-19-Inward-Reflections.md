# Inward Reflections

I've learned to observe, deep within my core,

No longer engage, in battles of yore.

Be it praise or critique, I now let it go,

But kindness I cherish, in my heart it will glow.

Misdeeds won't escape me, in memory they'll stay,

Life's a grand game, I'm learning to play.

Wherever the road's rough, be it today or tomorrow,

In this game of existence, I'll conquer each sorrow.
