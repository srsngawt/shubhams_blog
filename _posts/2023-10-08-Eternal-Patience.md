# Eternal Patience

In shadows of today, you may or may not yet know,

The depths of love within me, I'll show.

Though now you're distant, my heart believes,

One day you'll see, and our love will weave.

<br>

Time's gentle touch can change the view,

From indifference now, to love anew.

In patience and hope, I'll always be,

For the day you'll love, just wait and see.

<br>
