# Microservices: Revolution

What are Microservices?

In the past, organizations and engineers predominantly worked within the confines of monolithic architectures.

<b>Monolithic architecture</b> is characterized by a single, extensive computing network that couples all aspects of a business concern. Essentially, it represents a single-unit structure that encapsulates the database, business logic, and user interface.

Any alteration or addition of a new feature in such an application necessitates updating the entire stack. This process is not only costly and time-consuming but also reveals its limitations when dealing with intricate and complex systems.

To address these challenges, engineers introduced the concept of a three-tier architecture, commonly known as the presentation layer, application layer, and data layer.

• <b>Presentation Layer</b>: This layer serves as the user interface and communication channel of the application, often referred to as the top-level tier.

• <b>Application Layer</b>: Positioned in the middle, this layer processes collected information and contains a specific set of business rules, known as the logic tier or middle-level tier.

• <b>Data Layer</b>: Also known as the database layer, it is responsible for storing and managing data.

While segregating the logic and data layers into distinct tiers represented an improvement, it was still a centralized approach to application design. This approach did not adequately address the challenges associated with complex applications, which can be incredibly difficult to:

• Maintain

• Evolve

• Scale

It creates the need for a paradigm shift in design philosophy, especially for organizations dealing with complex systems on the scale of Amazon and Google. The ideal solution lies in decomposing applications into manageable components or chunks, leading to the concept of *Microservices*.

<b>Microservices architecture</b> is characterized by dividing the logic and data layers into smaller, self-contained pieces, aptly named microservices. This architectural shift revolutionized the way complex applications are developed and managed. Microservices offer several advantages:

• <b>Ease of Maintenance</b>: Microservices allow for making changes by updating a specific microservice without affecting others or the entire stack. This modularity simplifies maintenance efforts.

• <b>Scalability</b>: Each microservice can be scaled independently, enabling more efficient resource allocation. This flexibility can result in cost savings.

• <b>Flexibility and Agility</b>: Microservices empower development teams to work on individual services, promoting faster adaptation to changing requirements.

• <b>Fault Isolation</b>: Microservices are isolated, reducing the risk of a failure in one service affecting the entire application.

• <b>Team Independence</b>: Different teams can develop and maintain separate microservices, fostering team autonomy and parallel development.

Complex applications such as Amazon’s e-commerce platform illustrate the power of microservices. In the past, the application resembled a complex puzzle with tightly interconnected pieces. Any attempt to modify one piece risked disrupting others. However, by adopting microservices, Amazon streamlined its development pipeline and made it easier to maintain and update the system.

Microservices have emerged as a transformative force in modern application development. They enable organizations to build and maintain complex systems with greater flexibility, scalability, and agility while mitigating risks associated with monolithic architectures.
