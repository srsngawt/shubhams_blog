# The Journey of Self-Belief

Have you ever wondered why children shine so bright,

With boundless self-belief, they take flight.

Why do they embrace challenges without a fuss,

Ready to prove themselves, they're so tenacious.


When you speak with children, you will see,

Their self-confidence often surpasses you and me.

In their hearts, a fire forever burns,

Confronting life's hurdles, at every turn.


Why do they persist, why do they rise,

Even when failure's shadow in their path lies?

These little ones, with courage so pure,

Find joy in standing strong, that's for sure.


In the early days, their challenges seem small,

Learning to walk, they stumble and fall.

But imagine being in their tiny shoes,

How many times they fall, they bruise.


Yet, they rise again, they don't retreat,

Challenges faced, victories sweet.

I hesitate to call them small trials,

For in a child's world, they span miles.


But if adults were to face these trials too,

The countless falls, the challenges anew,

Would we rise again, or just admit defeat,

Succumbing to trials, our own path to meet?


I've seen elders and youth, I must admit,

Who, despite experience, decide to quit.

Not just the elderly, but young ones too,

Abandon their efforts, it's sadly true.


These thoughts make me ponder, reflect and see,

Why children rise, what fuels their glee.

It's may be because of pressure or push or shove,

And may be because it's self-belief and love.


Waking early, a morning bath so clean,

School routines punctual, the daily scene.

Hours at school without a nap or rest,

These habits instill confidence, the best.


These habits form, day by day,

Instilling self-confidence, come what may.

And the struggles they face, it's clear,

Indirectly, they conquer fear.


Studying for an exam, even when on day last,

A small struggle, no matter the cost.

No other choice but to press ahead,

Giving up's not an option, they've said.


Passing that exam, grades good or fair,

A boost to their self-confidence, rare.

These children, they're made of tough stuff,

Resilience in abundance, strong enough.


When elders say, "It can't be done,"

Children, they rise like the morning sun.

They've learned to win against themselves,

Overcoming challenges, like books on shelves.


As children grow, they often start,

To mimic their elders, playing the part.

They watch the world and start to believe,

Real fun's is not doing, that's what they conceive.


They think they're carefree, the world unaware,

But it's all a trick, a false affair.

Their two-day flex, it becomes a trend,

Slowly consuming them, no way to mend.


They sit with young ones, trying to learn,

As the lessons of life take a different turn.

To those whose habits have slipped away,

Discipline's the path, I must say.


Remove 'no' from your choices, one by one,

With each success, a new day begun.

Believe in yourself, let your confidence soar,

Embrace life's challenges, and you'll want more.


Thank you for listening to this tale,

Of children's belief, a journey we unveil.

Their resilience, their courage, so bold,

A story of self-belief, forever told.
