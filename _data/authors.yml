      <p>Hiii  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampavangandhi/iampavangandhi/master/gifs/Hi.gif" width="30px" style="display: inline-block;"></p><p> My name is Shubham Sangawat. I have completed my graduation (B.Tech) in Information Technology from NIT Kurukshetra. I will be joining Amazon as a Software Development Engineer in January 2024. I also have an experience in working with Udaan as an intern in the role of an analyst, where I was responsible for the successful migration of the LM DoD Tracker Dashboard, Cost Optimization, Python Auto Mailer, formulation of Buyer Plans, Code Optimization, and Routing Simulation.</p><p>Apart from this, I like poetry, listening to songs, drawing sketches, running, exercising, watching podcasts & World Affairs videos, and reading books. I also love to know about history and human evolution.</p><p>And further search is going on. Sure, if I come to know something, I will add it here.</p>
